# Smartphone Data Analysis

Welcome to the "Smartphone Data Analysis" project repository! In this project, we explore and analyze smartphone data to extract insights into various aspects of the market. The analysis is organized into three Jupyter Notebook files, each serving a specific purpose:

## 1. [Smartphone Web Scraping From Flipkart]([Smartphone%20Web%20Scraping%20From%20Flipkart.ipynb](https://github.com/PranjalDhamane/Smartphone_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Smartphone_Web_Scrapping_From_Filpkart.ipynb))
   - **Objective:** Utilize web scraping techniques to extract smartphone data from Flipkart.
   - **Tools Used:** Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, pandas, requests, and csv.
   - **Outcome:** A comprehensive dataset containing information on different smartphone models, their specifications, and prices.

## 2. [Smartphone Data Cleaning](Smartphone%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
   - **Objective:** Focus on essential data cleaning and transformation steps using numpy and pandas.
   - **Tasks:** Address missing values, handle outliers, and structure the data for meaningful analysis.
   - **Outcome:** A clean and well-organized dataset ready for in-depth exploratory data analysis.

## 3. [Smartphone Exploratory Data Analysis](Smartphone%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
   - **Objective:** Delve into exploratory data analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
   - **Methods:** Apply statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the smartphone data.
   - **Outcome:** Gain insights into market trends, popular features, and price distribution for informed decision-making.
